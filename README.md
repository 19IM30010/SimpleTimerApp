# SimpleTimerApp
Single Screen App

Made the Input Buttons in Minutes

Then Start Button 

After That The Timer will go down and refreshed Every Second

You Can Click on the Reset Button

or Make the App run in the background when the time it up a notification will come on the phone 

I will give the Video Demo Also

I made two file 

MainActivity.kt where all the components are present like text input and buttons

and 

TimerViewModel.kt for all the functions like reset_timer , start_timer, and the Notification Button

The File location is SimpleTimerApp\app\src\main\java\com\example\simpletimerapp
